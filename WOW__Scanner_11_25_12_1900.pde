Toy barcode scanner for the World of Wonder Childrens museum in Lafayette, CO

This code is functional, but a work in progress! (make it smaller, better, faster and more reliable)

Theory of operation: 
A Sharp IR proximity sensor is looking up through a window checking for any objects above it. If it finds something, we blink a nice big red LED and make a beep sound.
The brightness of the LED is controllable from full off to full on.
The sensitivity fo the proximity sensor is adjustable to compensate for ambient light and to prevent false triggers.
The volume of the beeper is controlable, but not in software. Volume is set via a pot and a LM386 amplifier. (full off to full on)

Hardware: base proto board with an Arduino Pro on top. A proto sheild on top has the audio amp  and headers for the pot board

TO DO: 
Add code for a status LED that indicates the main loop is running. I thought I'd use mills and a timer to slowly flash an LED so we know if the software has stopped running.
FUTURE possibility of using I2C for an external "price" display? Might be overkill for little kids.
Revise the hardware sometime in the future to use a printed circiut board rather than proto board. (more professional and less likely to have mysterious glitches)
I've had some issues with the reliability of stacking headers. It seems if they are not perfectly straight, they may have continuity issues. Change machined pin headers?
Still need to create an up to date schematic in Eagle and make some board files. Switch off serial debugging once things are running smoothly. (speed up the code)
